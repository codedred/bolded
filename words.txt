Here's the word of the top section (I'll send you the rest tomorrow):

You live in a 9ft x 5ft x 6ft box with 5 family members.

You wake up with no food. No light. No electricity.

No one around you have a job that requires a CV.

They said you are stuck.

You look at yourself.

You had a body. And you knew it could move.

That mean you are not stuck.

You work at fast-food 8 hours a day.

You go to school 7 hours the same day.

You study 4 hours the same day.

You sell vegetables in the market. Do laundry for friends. Sell snacks in school. You do anything needed to keep going.

You cannot be stopped.

You sleep 5 hours a day.

You forget to get tired.

Some people look at you and think you should stop now, rest now.

You are still moving.

Because you refuse to get stuck.

BOLDED is about celebrating underprivileged young people as strong human beings. They need to go through walls everyday to survive is a testament of their toughness -- an attribute to win in the business world.

Perception is everything. Sometimes we forgot the way we choose to see the world can change the course of life and history on this planet.

By introducing a new way of appreciating underprivileged people, we hope to lead to more and better employment opportunities for them.
