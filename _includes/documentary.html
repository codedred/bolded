        <p class="doc-text"> We are filming a short documentary series that aim to give underprivileged people a new and more fitted image </p>   
        <p class="doc-text"> — a “fighter” image. </p> 
        <p class="doc-text"> The fact that they need to go through walls everyday to survive is a testament of their toughness — an attribute to win in the business world. We believe the new image can lead to better employment opportunities for the lower­income people. Philippines is our first filming location. </p>
